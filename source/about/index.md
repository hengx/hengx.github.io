Hi~

My name is Heng. I'm currently pursuing a Master Degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University in Seattle-yes, NEU has a Seattle campus. :D

I am interested in learning new stuff, finding innovative ways to solve problems and writing clean and beautiful codes, although honestly these are areas I need a lot of work on. 

I did my bachelor in Information Systems at University of Washington, during which I took some marketing, finance, and accounting classes before I finally stepped into information techlogy. In the business school. I was exposed to an environment where communication, collaboration, and teamworks are super important. Then during my senior year, I find myself more interested in what's behind these technologies and softwares, so I decided to quit the marketing/finance intern I was doing, and put myself to a graduate school.

Looking back, I found myself made so many mistakes and wasted so much time. I struggled a lot when I was first exposed to complicated algorithms and coding. Nonetheless, things got better as I progressed. I'm aware it's probably going to take me some time to say I'm the expert of an area, but I'm sure that day will come, in the near future.
